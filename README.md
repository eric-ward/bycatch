### This repo demonstrates how to (1) fit a simple Bayesian GLM model to time series of observed bycatch and effort data (effort may be sets, hooks, trips, etc), and (2) in scenarios with less than 100% observer coverage, expand the estimated bycatch to the total (including unobserved vessels / trips)
